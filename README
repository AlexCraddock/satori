Satori is an elegant and clean color scheme for Vim, both for white or black
background terminals. This color scheme has been developed under
Terminall.app on Mac OS X but it also looks great in Linux too.

Install details:

Download satori.vim
$ mkdir -p ~/.vim/colors/
$ cp satori.vim ~/.vim/colors/
Edit .vimrc and insert "colorscheme satori"
